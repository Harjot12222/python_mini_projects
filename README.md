# Python Mini Projects

A collection of beginner-to-intermediate Python projects.  
The goal is to progressively build coding foundations and move toward real-world applications in machine learning.

## Projects

1. âœ… To-Do List  
2. âœ… Quiz Game  
3. âœ… Number Guessing Game  
4. âœ… Expense Tracker  
5. âœ… Spam Detector  
6. âœ… Contact Manager  
7. âœ… Calculator  
... (more coming soon ðŸš€)

## Skills Covered
- Python fundamentals (loops, conditionals, functions, error handling)  
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, nested dictionaries)  
- Basic algorithms (searching, filtering, simple analytics)  
- Early steps toward machine learning-ready datasets  

## Roadmap
- More data-analytics style projects  
- Machine Learning from scratch (KNN, Regression, Naive Bayes)  
- Portfolio-level ML projects using scikit-learn / Keras
