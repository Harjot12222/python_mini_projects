# Python Mini Projects

A collection of beginner-to-intermediate Python projects.  
The goal is to progressively build coding foundations and move toward real-world applications in machine learning.

## Projects

1. ✅ To-Do List  
2. ✅ Quiz Game
3. ✅ Text analyser
4. ✅ Number Guessing Game  
5. ✅ Expense Tracker  
6. ✅ Spam Detector  
7. ✅ Contact Manager  
8. ✅ Calculator 

## Skills Covered
- Python fundamentals (loops, conditionals, functions, error handling)  
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, nested dictionaries)  
- Basic algorithms (searching, filtering, simple analytics)  
- Early steps toward machine learning-ready datasets  

## Roadmap
- More data-analytics style projects  
- Machine Learning from scratch (KNN, Regression, Naive Bayes)  
- Portfolio-level ML projects using scikit-learn / Keras
